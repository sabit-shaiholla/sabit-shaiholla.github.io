    * Docker and Docker Compose are used for containerization, enabling easy deployment and environment management.
    * SonarQube is containerized as well, to ensure code quality.

## **3. Key Features and Implementation**

### **3.1. User Authentication and Authorization**

* Implemented using JWT to ensure secure authentication and authorization.
* Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
* Role-based access control is implemented to differentiate between admin, registered users, and guest users.

### **3.2. Player Search and Analytics**

* Users can search for players by name.
* The system retrieves player data from the database or fetches it from external sources.
* AI-generated analytics reports are generated using the Gemini Pro API and stored in the database.

### **3.3. Ratings and Reviews**

* Registered users can rate and review player analytics reports.
* User reviews are stored in the database and displayed alongside the reports.
* This feature fosters a community-driven approach to player analysis.

### **3.4. User Profiles**

* Users can manage their personal information, review history, and ratings.
* Profiles provide a personalized experience and enhance user engagement.

## **4. Implementation Details**

### **4.1. Backend Implementation**

* **RESTful API Design:**
    * The backend exposes a well-defined RESTful API using Spring MVC. Controllers are structured to handle specific resources (players, reports, users, reviews).
    * We adhere to REST principles, using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
    * API documentation is generated using Swagger UI, providing a clear interface for developers and testers.
* **Data Persistence with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate:**
    * Spring Data JPA simplifies database interactions by providing repositories that extend `JpaRepository`. This eliminates the need for manual SQL queries for common operations. [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa)
    * Hibernate, as the ORM provider, maps Java entities to database tables. Annotations like `@Entity`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, and `@JoinColumn` are used to define entity relationships. [Hibernate ORM](https://hibernate.org/orm/)
    * Lazy loading is carefully configured to optimize performance and prevent unnecessary database queries.
    * Transaction management is handled declaratively using `@Transactional` annotations, ensuring data integrity.
* **JWT Authentication and Authorization:**
    * JWTs are used for stateless authentication. Upon successful login, the backend generates a JWT containing user information and roles. [JWT](https://jwt.io/)
    * Spring Security is configured to intercept incoming requests, validate JWTs, and authorize access based on user roles. [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security)
    * Custom filters are implemented to extract and validate JWTs from request headers.
    * A `UserDetailsService` implementation is used to load user details from the database.
* **Database Migration with Flyway:**
    * Flyway ensures that database schema changes are tracked and applied consistently across different environments. [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/)
    * Migration scripts are stored in the `src/main/resources/db/migration` directory.
    * Flyway automatically applies pending migrations during application startup.
    * This approach simplifies database schema management and prevents inconsistencies.
* **Logging with Logback:**
    * Logback is configured to provide comprehensive logging for debugging, monitoring, and auditing. [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/)
    * Log levels (debug, info, warn, error) are used to control the verbosity of log messages.
    * Log messages include relevant context, such as timestamps, thread names, and class names.
    * Log files are rotated and archived to prevent excessive disk usage.
* **Error Handling:**
    * Custom exceptions are defined to represent specific error conditions.
    * `@ControllerAdvice` is used to handle exceptions globally, providing consistent error responses to the frontend.
    * Error responses include appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
* **Gemini Pro API Integration:**
    * The backend makes HTTP requests to the Gemini Pro API to generate player analytics. [Gemini Pro API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/models)
    * The results are parsed and saved to the database.
    * The API key is stored as an environment variable, ensuring security.
    * The api responses are checked for errors, and handled gracefully.

### **4.2. Database Implementation**

* **Schema Design:**
    * The database schema is normalized to minimize data redundancy and ensure data integrity.
    * Primary and foreign keys are used to enforce relationships between tables.
    * Indexes are created on frequently queried columns to improve query performance.
    * Data types are chosen carefully to optimize storage and performance. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)
* **Entity Relationships:**
    * `Player` and `PlayerReport` have a one-to-many relationship, with a player having multiple reports.
    * `User`, `Player` and `PlayerReport` have a many to many relationship through the `UserPlayerReview` table.
    * `Player` and `PlayerStatistics` have a one to many relationship.
* **Data Retrieval Optimization:**
    * JPQL queries are used to perform complex database queries efficiently.
    * Caching mechanisms (e.g., Hibernate's second-level cache) are considered to reduce database load.
    * Database connection pooling is configured to minimize connection overhead.
* **Data Validation:**
    * Database constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are used to enforce data integrity.
    * Backend validation is performed to ensure that data conforms to business rules.
* **Database Security:**
    * Access to the database is restricted using strong passwords and firewall rules.
    * Database backups are performed regularly to prevent data loss.
* **Data migration considerations:**
    * Initial population of player data is performed through batch jobs, processing data from external web pages.
    * Data consistency is checked after each migration.
* **Database indexing:**
    * Indexes are used on foreign key columns, and on columns that are used in where clauses.
    * Indexes are also used on columns that are used in join clauses.

### **4.3. Frontend Implementation**

* React is used to create a single-page application (SPA).
* Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend API. [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
* React Router is used for client-side routing. [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
* Components are designed to be reusable and maintainable
* State management is handled using React's built-in useState and useContext hooks.
* UI components are designed to be responsive and accessible.
* Form validation is implemented using libraries like Formik or React Hook Form.

## **5. Deployment and Configuration**

* Docker and Docker Compose are used for containerization and deployment. Docker Docker Compose
* The application is deployed as a set of containers, including the backend, frontend, database, and SonarQube.
* Environment variables are used to configure the application, including database credentials, API keys, and JWT secrets.
* A CI/CD pipeline, such as GitHub Actions, could be implemented to automate build, test, and deployment processes. GitHub Actions
* Nginx or Apache is used as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate containers.

## **6. Evaluation and Results**

* The system has been tested for functionality, performance, and security.
