## Source Code

The complete source code is available on GitHub:
[E-Commerce Microservices Repository](https://github.com/sabit-shaiholla/ecommerce-microservices)

## Core Technologies

The platform is built using the following technologies:

- **Java Spring Boot**: For microservice implementation
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**: For API gateway functionality
- **Spring Data JPA**: For data access layer
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization
- **MySQL**: For persistent data storage
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For containerization and service orchestration
- **Zipkin**: For distributed tracing
- **Eureka**: For service discovery
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: For API documentation

## Microservices Architecture Implementation

### Service Composition

The e-commerce platform is composed of the following microservices:

```mermaid

    A[API Gateway] --> B[Product Service]
    A --> C[Order Service]
    A --> D[Inventory Service]
    A --> E[Discovery Server]
    
    B -.-> F[(Product DB)]
    C -.-> G[(Order DB)]
    D -.-> H[(Inventory DB)]
    
    classDef service fill:#4285F4,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,color:white;
    classDef database fill:#34A853,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,color:white;
    classDef infrastructure fill:#FBBC05,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,color:white;
    
    class A,B,C,D service;
    class F,G,H database;
    class E infrastructure;
```

Each service has a specific business function:

1. **Product Service**: Manages product catalog and information
2. **Order Service**: Handles order creation and processing
3. **Inventory Service**: Manages product stock levels
4. **API Gateway**: Routes client requests to appropriate services
5. **Discovery Server**: Provides service registration and discovery

### API Gateway Implementation

The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all clients, implemented using Spring Cloud Gateway:

- **Routing**: Routes requests to the appropriate microservices based on path
- **Load Balancing**: Client-side load balancing for distributed instances
- **Integration with Discovery Service**: Dynamic service resolution

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: product-service
          uri: lb://product-service
          predicates:
            - Path=/api/product/**
        - id: order-service
          uri: lb://order-service
          predicates:
            - Path=/api/order/**
        - id: inventory-service
          uri: lb://inventory-service
          predicates:
            - Path=/api/inventory/**
```

### Service Discovery with Eureka

The project uses Netflix Eureka for service discovery, allowing services to find and communicate with each other without hardcoded URLs:

- **Service Registration**: Each microservice registers itself with Eureka
- **Service Discovery**: Services locate each other through the Eureka server
- **Health Monitoring**: Automatic detection of service health

This implementation allows for dynamic scaling and replacement of service instances without configuration changes.

### Inter-Service Communication

The project implements two communication patterns:

1. **Synchronous Communication (REST)** 
   - Used for immediate responses and direct service-to-service calls
   - Example: Checking inventory availability during order placement

2. **WebClient Integration**
   - Non-blocking HTTP requests between services
   - Example: Order service communicating with inventory service

```java
// Example of WebClient usage in Order Service
private final WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder;

public OrderService(WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder) {
    this.webClientBuilder = webClientBuilder;
}

private Boolean checkInventory(String skuCode) {
    return webClientBuilder.build().get()
        .uri("http://inventory-service/api/inventory/" + skuCode)
        .retrieve()
        .bodyToMono(Boolean.class)
        .block();
}
```

### Data Management Strategy

Each microservice has its own dedicated database:

- **Product Service Database**: Stores product information
- **Order Service Database**: Manages order data
- **Inventory Service Database**: Tracks product inventory levels

This approach provides:
- **Decoupling**: Changes to one service's data model don't affect others
- **Independent Scaling**: Database resources can be allocated according to service needs
- **Technology Independence**: Each service can use the database technology best suited to its requirements

### Containerization with Docker Compose

The entire application is containerized using Docker with Docker Compose for orchestration:

```yaml
# Excerpt from docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  ## MySQL Database
  mysql:
    container_name: mysql
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=order-service
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - ./mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    healthcheck:
      test: "/usr/bin/mysql --user=root --password=mysql --execute \"SHOW DATABASES;\""
      interval: 2s
      timeout: 20s
      retries: 10

  ## Zipkin
  zipkin:
    image: openzipkin/zipkin
    container_name: zipkin
    ports:
      - "9411:9411"

    container_name: discovery-server
    pull_policy: always
    ports:
      - "8761:8761"
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=docker
    depends_on:
      - zipkin

    depends_on:
      mysql:
        condition: service_healthy
      discovery-server:
        condition: service_started
      api-gateway:
        condition: service_started

  ## Inventory Service
  inventory-service:
    container_name: inventory-service
    image: ${DOCKER_USERNAME}/inventory-service:latest
    pull_policy: always
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=docker
    depends_on:
      mysql:
        condition: service_healthy
      discovery-server:
        condition: service_started
      api-gateway:
        condition: service_started
```

Benefits of using Docker Compose:
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Environment defined in version-controlled files
- **Consistency**: Identical environments across development and production
- **Simplified Deployment**: One command to start the entire system
- **Dependency Management**: Proper service startup order and health checks

### Distributed Tracing

The project implements distributed tracing with Zipkin:

- **Request Tracking**: Trace requests as they travel through multiple services
- **Performance Monitoring**: Identify bottlenecks and latency issues
- **Error Analysis**: Track where failures occur in the request chain

This provides valuable insights for debugging and performance optimization in a distributed environment.
